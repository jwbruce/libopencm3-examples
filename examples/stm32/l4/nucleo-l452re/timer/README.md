This example demonstrates the use of timers to trigger an interrupt. This
example will toggle a LED spelling out the following morse code:

SOS -> ... --- ...
DOT-DOT-DOT DASH-DASH-DASH DOT-DOT-DOT  repeat...

using international morse timing, with a dot element of 100ms

It's intended for the ST Nucelo-L452RE (STM32L452RE) evaluation
board. It should blink LD2 on the Nucleo board.
